<h2 id="docset-header">Puppet Report Reference <span class="version">2.7.21</span></h2> 
<p><em>(last generated on Mon Mar 18 10:58:01 -0700 2013)</em></p>

<p>Puppet clients can report back to the server after each transaction.  This
transaction report is sent as a YAML dump of the
<code>Puppet::Transaction::Report</code> class and includes every log message that was
generated during the transaction along with as many metrics as Puppet knows how
to collect.  See <a rel="external" href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Reports_And_Reporting">Reports and Reporting</a> for more information on how to use reports.</p>

<p>Currently, clients default to not sending in reports; you can enable reporting
by setting the <code>report</code> parameter to true.</p>

<p>To use a report, set the <code>reports</code> parameter on the server; multiple
reports must be comma-separated.  You can also specify <code>none</code> to disable
reports entirely.</p>

<p>Puppet provides multiple report handlers that will process client reports:</p>

<h2 id="http">http</h2>
<p>Send report information via HTTP to the <code>reporturl</code>. Each host sends
its report as a YAML dump and this sends this YAML to a client via HTTP POST.
The YAML is the body of the request.</p>

<h2 id="log">log</h2>
<p>Send all received logs to the local log destinations.  Usually
the log destination is syslog.</p>

<h2 id="rrdgraph">rrdgraph</h2>
<p>Graph all available data about hosts using the RRD library.  You
must have the Ruby RRDtool library installed to use this report, which
you can get from 
<a rel="external" href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyrrdtool/">the RubyRRDTool RubyForge page</a>.<br />
This package may also be available as <code>ruby-rrd</code> or <code>rrdtool-ruby</code> in your 
distribution&#8217;s package management system.  The library and/or package will both 
require the binary <code>rrdtool</code> package from your distribution to be installed.</p>

<p>This report will create, manage, and graph RRD database files for each
of the metrics generated during transactions, and it will create a
few simple html files to display the reporting host&#8217;s graphs.  At this
point, it will not create a common index file to display links to
all hosts.</p>

<p>All RRD files and graphs get created in the <code>rrddir</code> directory.  If
you want to serve these publicly, you should be able to just alias that
directory in a web server.</p>

<p>If you really know what you&#8217;re doing, you can tune the <code>rrdinterval</code>,
which defaults to the <code>runinterval</code>.</p>

<h2 id="store">store</h2>
<p>Store the yaml report on disk.  Each host sends its report as a YAML dump
and this just stores the file on disk, in the <code>reportdir</code> directory.</p>

<p>These files collect quickly &#8211; one every half hour &#8211; so it is a good idea
to perform some maintenance on them if you use this report (it&#8217;s the only
default report).</p>

<h2 id="tagmail">tagmail</h2>
<p>This report sends specific log messages to specific email addresses
based on the tags in the log messages.  </p>

<p>See the <a rel="external" href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Using_Tags">documentation on tags</a> for more information.</p>

<p>To use this report, you must create a <code>tagmail.conf</code> file in the location
specified by the <code>tagmap</code> setting.  This is a simple file that maps tags to
email addresses:  Any log messages in the report that match the specified
tags will be sent to the specified email addresses.</p>

<p>Lines in the <code>tagmail.conf</code> file consist of a comma-separated list
of tags, a colon, and a comma-separated list of email addresses.
Tags can be !negated with a leading exclamation mark, which will
subtract any messages with that tag from the set of events handled
by that line.</p>

<p>Puppet&#8217;s log levels (<code>debug</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>notice</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>err</code>,
<code>alert</code>, <code>emerg</code>, <code>crit</code>, and <code>verbose</code>) can also be used as tags,
and there is an <code>all</code> tag that will always match all log messages.</p>

<p>An example <code>tagmail.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>all: me@domain.com
webserver, !mailserver: httpadmins@domain.com
</code></pre>

<p>This will send all messages to <code>me@domain.com</code>, and all messages from
webservers that are not also from mailservers to <code>httpadmins@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>If you are using anti-spam controls such as grey-listing on your mail
server, you should whitelist the sending email address (controlled by
<code>reportform</code> configuration option) to ensure your email is not discarded as spam.</p>
