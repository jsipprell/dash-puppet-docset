<h2 id="docset-header">Puppet Language: Containment of Resources <span class="version">2.7.21</span></h2>

<h2 id="containment">Containment</h2>
<p><a href="./lang_classes.html">Classes</a> and <a href="./lang_defined_types.html">defined type</a> instances <strong>contain</strong> the resources they declare. This means that if any resource or class forms a <a href="./lang_relationships.html">relationship</a> with the container, it will form the same relationship with every resource inside the container. </p>
<pre><code>  class ntp {
    file {'/etc/ntp.conf':
      ...
      require =&gt; Package['ntp'],
      notify  =&gt; Service['ntp'],
    }
    service {'ntp':
      ...
    }
    package {'ntp':
      ...
    }
  }

  include ntp
  exec {'/usr/local/bin/update_custom_timestamps.sh':
    require =&gt; Class['ntp'],
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>Exec['/usr/local/bin/update_custom_timestamps.sh']</code> would happen after <em>every</em> resource in the ntp class, including the package, the file, and the service.</p>
<p>This feature also allows you to <a href="./lang_relationships.html#ordering-and-notification">notify and subscribe to</a> classes and defined resource types as though they were a single resource. </p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<p><strong>Classes do not get contained by the class or defined type that declares them.</strong> This is a known design problem, and can be tracked at <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/8040">issue #8040</a>.</p>
<pre><code>  class ntp {
    include ntp::conf_file

    service {'ntp':
      ...
    }
    package {'ntp':
      ...
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, a resource with a <code>require =&gt; Class['ntp']</code> metaparameter would be applied after both <code>Package['ntp']</code> and <code>Service['ntp']</code>, but <strong>would not necessarily</strong> happen after any of the resources contained by the <code>ntp::conf_file</code> class; those resources would "float off" outside the NTP class.</p>
<h3 id="context-and-plans">Context and Plans</h3>
<p>Containment is a singleton and is absolute: a resource can only be contained by one container (although the container, in turn, may be contained). However, classes can be declared in multiple places with the <code>include</code> function. A naïve interpretation would thus imply that classes can be in multiple containers at once. </p>
<p>Puppet 0.25 and prior would establish a containment edge with the <em>first</em> container in which a class was declared. This made containment dependent on parse-order, which was bad. However, fixing this unpredictability in 2.6 left no native way for the main "public" class in a module to completely own its subordinate implementation classes. This makes it hard to keep very large modules readable, since it complicates and obscures logical relationships in large blocks of code.</p>
<p>Puppet Labs is investigating ways to resolve this for a future Puppet version. </p>
<h3 id="workaround-the-anchor-pattern">Workaround: The Anchor Pattern</h3>
<p>You can cause a class to act like it's contained in another class by "holding it in place" with both a <code>require</code> and <code>before</code> relationship to resources that ARE contained:</p>
<pre><code>  class ntp {
    include ntp::conf_file

    package {'ntp':
      ...
      before =&gt; Class['ntp::conf_file'],
    }
    service {'ntp':
      ...
      subscribe =&gt; Class['ntp::conf_file'], 
      # Remember that 'subscribe' is effectively 'require, and also...'
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>ntp::conf_file</code> class still isn't technically contained, but any resource can safely form a relationship with the <code>ntp</code> class and rest assured that the relationship will propagate into all relevant resources. </p>
<p>Since this anchoring behavior is effectively an invisible side effect of the relationships inside the class, you should not rely on relationships with normal resources. Instead, you should use the <code>anchor</code> resource type included in the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib">puppetlabs-stdlib module</a>, which exists solely for this purpose. </p>
