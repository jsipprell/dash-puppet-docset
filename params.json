See [here][1] for more information on puppet.\r\n\r\nThis was a fairly fast-paced attempt, at as yet there is no way to automate pulling in the html generated from puppet-docs,\r\nas it embeds a lot of unrelated content (site navigation, etc) into each page. I removed all extraneous content and\r\npaired it down to the fundamentals manually. I also had to make some minor modifications to the css, although I tried to\r\nstay away from anything that was fundamental to the look-and-feel of the reference itself.\r\n\r\nRegenerating the docset Index\r\n-----------------------------\r\nThe Dash docset sqlite index can be regenerated via:\r\n\r\n    $ echo 'delete from searchIndex;' | sqlite3 puppet.docset/Contents/Resources/docSet.dsidx\r\n    $ ./regen-sql-index.sh | sqlite3 puppet.docset/Contents/Resources/docSet.dsidx\r\n\r\nFeed\r\n----\r\n~~A dash installable feed is available here (you'll need to open it inside Dash, I've nowhere to serve a url-encoded *dash-feed://* url from): https://raw.github.com/jsipprell/dash-puppet-docset/master/Puppet.xml~~\r\n\r\nAn automatic feed is currently unavailable and downloading the xml from the above link also won't work. Unfortunately,\r\nYou'll need to download the tarball directly from github and load it manually. Sorry, I don't have time to figure\r\nout the problem at the moment, but I assure you that manually opening the .docset \"file\" (found in the tarball)\r\nfrom either Finder or Dash will work.\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n------\r\n* There isn't always clear mapping between Dash docset \"Entry Types\" and the elements of the [puppet reference manual][3].\r\n  For example, \"Indirections\" -- I've set those to Dash's \"Interface\" type, but that obviously isn't really right.\r\n* The docset index page is set to the puppet types page because it's what I use most, but it would probably be good to pull in\r\n  something more generic/appropriate from puppet-docs.\r\n* Only 2.7.21 docs (really, 2.7.\"latest\") at the moment.\r\n* Automation for pulling in docs from the original puppet markdown or modifying the puppet-docs regen\r\n  is some fashion so that it can generate a docset.\r\n* Figure out how to provide nested references ala some of the other docsets (Python, Apple, etc)\r\n\r\n[1]: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs\r\n[3]: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
